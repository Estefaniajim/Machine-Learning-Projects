# Machine Learning Projects
<p>
 <b>The Basics folder </b> is a recopilation of information about the basics of machine learning gathered from my bootcamp of Machine Learning for Software Engineers in educative.io 
 </p>
The Basics folder:
<ul>
 <li><b>Data Manipulation with NumPy</b>: NumPy Arrays, NumPy Basic Operations, Arithmetic and Linear Algebra work in NumPy, Generate numbers and arrays from different random distributions, Index into NumPy arrays to extract data and array slices, Filter NumPy data for specific values, Statistical Metrics to NumPy data, Aggregation techniques to combine NumPy data and arrays, Saving and Loading NumPy data </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
 <li><b>Data Analysis with pandas</b>: pandas Series object for 1-D data, pandas DataFrame object for 2-D data, concatenation and merging, indexing, Read from and write to different types of files in pandas, grouping, feature types, filter DataFrames, sort DataFrames, statistical metrics for data, pyplot API from Matplotlib, converted to 2-D NumPy arrays</li>
 </ul>
