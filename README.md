# Machine Learning Projects
<p>
 <b>The Machine Learning Foundations Coursera folder </b> is a recopilation of information gather in my coursera certification in Machine Learning Foundations by the University of Washinton.
The course used turicreate but instead I use scikit-learn and pandas in order to complete the code for the course.
 </p>
 The Machine Learning Foundations Coursera folder:
<ul>
 <li><b>Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach</b>:Linear Regression</li>
 </ul>
<p>
 <b>The Basics folder </b> is a recopilation of information about the basics of machine learning gathered from my bootcamp of Machine Learning for Software Engineers in educative.io 
 </p>
The Basics folder:
<ul>
 <li><b>Data Manipulation with NumPy</b>: NumPy Arrays, NumPy Basic Operations, Arithmetic and Linear Algebra work in NumPy, Generate numbers and arrays from different random distributions, Index into NumPy arrays to extract data and array slices, Filter NumPy data for specific values, Statistical Metrics to NumPy data, Aggregation techniques to combine NumPy data and arrays, Saving and Loading NumPy data </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
 <li><b>Data Analysis with pandas</b>: pandas Series object for 1-D data, pandas DataFrame object for 2-D data, concatenation and merging, indexing, Read from and write to different types of files in pandas, grouping, feature types, filter DataFrames, sort DataFrames, statistical metrics for data, pyplot API from Matplotlib, converted to 2-D NumPy arrays</li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li><b>Data Preprocessing with scikit-learn</b>: Data Standardization, Range Scaling, Robust scaling, Data Normalization, Data Imputation, PCA, PCA components</li>
 </ul>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Data Modeling with scikit-learn</b>: Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Regularization with LASSO regression, Bayesian regression techniques, Logistic Regression for Classification Tasks, Decision Trees, Training and Testing sets, K-Fold cross-validation, K-Fold cross-validation to decision trees, Evaluation of Classification and Regression models, Exhaustive Grid Search Techniques for Hyperparameter Tuning</li>
 </ul>
   <ul>
 <li><b>Clustering with scikit-learn</b>: Cosine similarity metric,  Nearest neighbors for data points, K-Means clustering algorithm, Hierarchical clustering via the agglomerative approach, Mean shift clustering, DBSCAN clustering algorithm, Evaluation on the performance of clustering algorithms, Agglomerative clustering for feature dimensionality reduction</li>
 </ul>
